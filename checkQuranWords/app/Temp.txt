<td>The Opening<

In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.





<td>The Opening<

[All] praise is [due] to Allah, Lord of the worlds -





<td>The Opening<

The Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful,





<td>The Opening<

Sovereign of the Day of Recompense.





<td>The Opening<

It is You we worship and You we ask for help.





<td>The Opening<

Guide us to the straight path -





<td>The Opening<

The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray.





<td>The Cow<

Alif, Lam, Meem.





<td>The Cow<

This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah -





<td>The Cow<

Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them,





<td>The Cow<

And who believe in what has been revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what was revealed before you, and of the Hereafter they are certain [in faith].





<td>The Cow<

Those are upon [right] guidance from their Lord, and it is those who are the successful.





<td>The Cow<

Indeed, those who disbelieve - it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe.





<td>The Cow<

Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and over their vision is a veil. And for them is a great punishment.





<td>The Cow<

And of the people are some who say, We believe in Allah and the Last Day, but they are not believers.





<td>The Cow<

They [think to] deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive not except themselves and perceive [it] not.





<td>The Cow<

In their hearts is disease, so Allah has increased their disease; and for them is a painful punishment because they [habitually] used to lie.





<td>The Cow<

And when it is said to them, Do not cause corruption on the earth, they say, We are but reformers.





<td>The Cow<

Unquestionably, it is they who are the corrupters, but they perceive [it] not.





<td>The Cow<

And when it is said to them, Believe as the people have believed, they say, Should we believe as the foolish have believed? Unquestionably, it is they who are the foolish, but they know [it] not.





<td>The Cow<

And when they meet those who believe, they say, We believe; but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say, Indeed, we are with you; we were only mockers.





<td>The Cow<

[But] Allah mocks them and prolongs them in their transgression [while] they wander blindly.





<td>The Cow<

Those are the ones who have purchased error [in exchange] for guidance, so their transaction has brought no profit, nor were they guided.





<td>The Cow<

Their example is that of one who kindled a fire, but when it illuminated what was around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness [so] they could not see.





<td>The Cow<

Deaf, dumb and blind - so they will not return [to the right path].





<td>The Cow<

Or [it is] like a rainstorm from the sky within which is darkness, thunder and lightning. They put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps in dread of death. But Allah is encompassing of the disbelievers.





<td>The Cow<

The lightning almost snatches away their sight. Every time it lights [the way] for them, they walk therein; but when darkness comes over them, they stand [still]. And if Allah had willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.





<td>The Cow<

O mankind, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, that you may become righteous -





<td>The Cow<

[He] who made for you the earth a bed [spread out] and the sky a ceiling and sent down from the sky, rain and brought forth thereby fruits as provision for you. So do not attribute to Allah equals while you know [that there is nothing similar to Him].





<td>The Cow<

And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our Servant [Muhammad], then produce a surah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses other than Allah, if you should be truthful.





<td>The Cow<

But if you do not - and you will never be able to - then fear the Fire, whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.





<td>The Cow<

And give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, This is what we were provided with before. And it is given to them in likeness. And they will have therein purified spouses, and they will abide therein eternally.





<td>The Cow<

Indeed, Allah is not timid to present an example - that of a mosquito or what is smaller than it. And those who have believed know that it is the truth from their Lord. But as for those who disbelieve, they say, What did Allah intend by this as an example? He misleads many thereby and guides many thereby. And He misleads not except the defiantly disobedient,





<td>The Cow<

Who break the covenant of Allah after contracting it and sever that which Allah has ordered to be joined and cause corruption on earth. It is those who are the losers.





<td>The Cow<

How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were lifeless and He brought you to life; then He will cause you to die, then He will bring you [back] to life, and then to Him you will be returned.





<td>The Cow<

It is He who created for you all of that which is on the earth. Then He directed Himself to the heaven, [His being above all creation], and made them seven heavens, and He is Knowing of all things.





<td>The Cow<

And [mention, O Muhammad], when your Lord said to the angels, Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority. They said, Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your praise and sanctify You? Allah said, Indeed, I know that which you do not know.





<td>The Cow<

And He taught Adam the names - all of them. Then He showed them to the angels and said, Inform Me of the names of these, if you are truthful.





<td>The Cow<

They said, Exalted are You; we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Indeed, it is You who is the Knowing, the Wise.





<td>The Cow<

He said, O Adam, inform them of their names. And when he had informed them of their names, He said, Did I not tell you that I know the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth? And I know what you reveal and what you have concealed.





<td>The Cow<

And [mention] when We said to the angels, Prostrate before Adam; so they prostrated, except for Iblees. He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers.





<td>The Cow<

And We said, O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and eat therefrom in [ease and] abundance from wherever you will. But do not approach this tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers.





<td>The Cow<

But Satan caused them to slip out of it and removed them from that [condition] in which they had been. And We said, Go down, [all of you], as enemies to one another, and you will have upon the earth a place of settlement and provision for a time.





<td>The Cow<

Then Adam received from his Lord [some] words, and He accepted his repentance. Indeed, it is He who is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful.





<td>The Cow<

We said, Go down from it, all of you. And when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.





<td>The Cow<

And those who disbelieve and deny Our signs - those will be companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.





<td>The Cow<

O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you and fulfill My covenant [upon you] that I will fulfill your covenant [from Me], and be afraid of [only] Me.





<td>The Cow<

And believe in what I have sent down confirming that which is [already] with you, and be not the first to disbelieve in it. And do not exchange My signs for a small price, and fear [only] Me.





<td>The Cow<

And do not mix the truth with falsehood or conceal the truth while you know [it].





<td>The Cow<

And establish prayer and give zakah and bow with those who bow [in worship and obedience].





<td>The Cow<

Do you order righteousness of the people and forget yourselves while you recite the Scripture? Then will you not reason?





<td>The Cow<

And seek help through patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humbly submissive [to Allah]





<td>The Cow<

Who are certain that they will meet their Lord and that they will return to Him.





<td>The Cow<

O Children of Israel, remember My favor that I have bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over the worlds.





<td>The Cow<

And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will compensation be taken from it, nor will they be aided.





<td>The Cow<

And [recall] when We saved your forefathers from the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with the worst torment, slaughtering your [newborn] sons and keeping your females alive. And in that was a great trial from your Lord.





<td>The Cow<

And [recall] when We parted the sea for you and saved you and drowned the people of Pharaoh while you were looking on.





<td>The Cow<

And [recall] when We made an appointment with Moses for forty nights. Then you took [for worship] the calf after him, while you were wrongdoers.





<td>The Cow<

Then We forgave you after that so perhaps you would be grateful.





<td>The Cow<

And [recall] when We gave Moses the Scripture and criterion that perhaps you would be guided.





<td>The Cow<

And [recall] when Moses said to his people, O my people, indeed you have wronged yourselves by your taking of the calf [for worship]. So repent to your Creator and kill yourselves. That is best for [all of] you in the sight of your Creator. Then He accepted your repentance; indeed, He is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful.





<td>The Cow<

And [recall] when you said, O Moses, we will never believe you until we see Allah outright; so the thunderbolt took you while you were looking on.





<td>The Cow<

Then We revived you after your death that perhaps you would be grateful.
